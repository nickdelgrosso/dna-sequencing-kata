# DNA Transcription and Translation Kata

![](/dna_diagram.png)

This is a bioinformatics-related code kata designed for practicing test-driven development in tasks that involve data processing.

## Goal:

Write a program that can take a DNA sequence as input and, as output, show all the hypothetical protein sequences that could be translated from it.

Example:
  - Input DNA Sequence: **AGGACGGGCTAACTCCGCTCGTCACAAAGCGCAATGCAGCTATGGCAGATGTTCATGCCG**
  - Output Protein Sequence: **MNICHSCIALCDERS**

### Specifications:

Below are the specifications in written form.  For a diagram, see the picture **dna_kata_explanation.png** in this folder.

  1. DNA sequences are sequences of A, T, C, and G *nucleotides*.
    a. *Example DNA Sequence*: ttatttgggcatcc
    b. Because DNA is double-stranded, for every dna sequence there is also the **antisense** sequence, which is the sequence reversed and changed in the following pattern: A->T, T->A, C->G, G->C

  2. DNA is *transcribed* into RNA sequences, which contain A, U, C, and G *nucleotides*.
    a. DNA is read in reverse order.
    b. RNA transcription follows the following pattern: A->U, T->A, C->G, G->C.
    d. *Example Transcription*: TTATGCATC -> GAUGCAUAA

  3. RNA is *translated* into a protein sequence by converting sets of 3 nucleotides (called a *codon*) into a single *peptide*.
    a. RNA is read in the forwards direction and can be started from the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd nucleotide.
    b. The table "codons.json" contains the relationships between RNA codons and the peptides produced.
    c. The first peptide in the protein sequence is always **Met** -- everything beforehand is ignored.
    d. The last peptide in the sequence is always the one before a "STOP" codon--everything afterward, including the first STOP, is ignored.
    e. If there is no "Met" to start the sequence and no "STOP" to end it, no protein sequence is created at all.  
    f. Protein sequences are written as one-letter codes.  The file "peptides.json" contains the relationship between the three- and one-letter codes.
    g. *Example Translation from RNA*: ggaugcccaaauaa -> [Met, Pro, Lys] == MPK

Try it out using this [online tool](https://web.expasy.org/translate/) and type in the following sequence: **ttatttgggcatcc** and press the "Translate" button, and look for the protein sequence highlighted in red.
